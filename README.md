2. Request a free API key
3. Once you receive your key, replace `YOUR_OMDB_API_KEY` in `script.js`:
   ```javascript
   const API_KEY = 'your-actual-api-key-here';
   ```

## Local Storage

All ratings, reviews, favorites, and watchlist items are stored in the browser's Local Storage, keyed by movie ID. This means:

- Your reviews persist even after closing the browser
- Each movie maintains its own set of reviews
- Favorites and watchlist are saved locally
- Data is stored locally and is specific to your browser
